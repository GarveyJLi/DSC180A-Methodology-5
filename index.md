DSC 180A A01: Precision Genomics with Personalized Genetic Risk Prediction

Tiffany Amariuta


1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting topic covered so far has been the implications of deploying risk prediction methods using PRS in clinical use. The issues that arise range from issues stemming from disparaties in the data, potential misinterpretation of PRS, as well as potential misuse of genetic data by various entities (e.g. insurance companies). 

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Q2 Project might be something along the lines of analyzing the reliability of using PRS scores to predict genetic risk across various genetic variations/diseases and investigating why some results might be more reliable than others.

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A potential change I'd make to my approach for the Q1 project is to reformat my code to better use the bioinformatics tools already in existence rather than creating my own, as creating my own tools would take up too much time.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

I would be interested in using other techniques (asides from linear regression) to generate scores similar to PRS that would also allow for genetic risk prediction (such as PCA or SVMs).
